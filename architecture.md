# Mute Block Architecture

Date: 2026-05-20

This is the canonical architecture front door for the active `1.6`/`2.0`
stabilization line. Use [planning.md](planning.md) for priority and sequencing;
use this note for the durable model and design constraints.

## Core Authority Model

The service worker is the mutation authority for queued work.

Durable queue state is the desired state. Browser tabs, content-script state,
progress mirrors, dashboard state, and runtime maps are observations or caches
unless they have been converted into reducer-approved durable events.

The central rule:

```text
durable queue state + live browser observations
  -> bounded reconcile tick
  -> durable state changes + minimal side effects
```

Direct actions are allowed to reduce latency. They are not allowed to become a
second authority path.

## Scheduler / Reconciler

The live-debug work has shown that "repair" is increasingly the normal
processing mechanism. Treat that deliberately: the normal queue processor should
be a reconciler/scheduler tick, not several separate direct paths plus a broad
exception handler.

Each tick should be two-phase:

1. Observe: load the bounded durable state needed for the tick, inspect owned
   tabs and candidate tabs, collect content-script claims, challenge state, and
   recent progress.
2. Decide and apply: produce durable transitions and side effects, then perform
   them under token checks and budget limits.

Important fixed-point cases:

- `queued + no runtime`: durably claim, then open/nudge as provisional side
  effect.
- `active + matching confirmed runtime`: continue, observe, or nudge.
- `active + no matching runtime`: adopt by token or release/requeue/fail.
- `runtime + no matching durable active row`: detach/close as orphan or stale
  provisional fallout.
- `terminal + runtime`: close/detach.
- `challenge/no progress timeout`: retry or fail according to policy.

Confirmation requires row id plus attempt/claim token, and tab id where
applicable. Row id alone is not enough under delayed storage writes.

## Runtime Caches

Runtime structures such as `queuedTabActions`, `queuedTabMetadata`, and
`activeQueuedTabs` are caches derived from durable rows and live observations.
They must not block scheduling unless they match durable active authority.

Use separate concepts for:

- candidate tab: visible/live tab that might match a row;
- provisional actor: side effect that has been issued but not durably
  confirmed;
- confirmed actor: durable active row and runtime tab/action match by token;
- orphan actor: runtime work with no durable authority;
- stranded active row: durable active row with no confirmed runtime actor.

Both orphan actors and stranded active rows are ordinary reconcile cases.

## Storage Authority

Ordinary queue/progress/runs changes should not be scattered full-map
load/edit/save operations. The storage authority layer should make mutation
reasons explicit and keep compatibility paths from creating truth.

Near-term requirements:

- reason-tag all snapshot writes;
- inventory full-state load/save call sites;
- quarantine or remove compatibility writers;
- prevent content scripts from writing coordinator authority maps directly;
- keep executor startup behind durable authority;
- add tests that make new direct authority writes visible.

The target storage design is WAL plus A/B checkpoints:

- ordinary mutations append compact reducer-shaped records;
- projection is `last checkpoint + ordered WAL records`;
- checkpoint generation switches write full checkpoints only when useful;
- A/B checkpoints provide a recoverable alternate snapshot;
- gzip is the first production compression target for checkpoint snapshots, with
  raw JSON fallback;
- WAL is durability/replay format, not an alternate state machine.

Terminology: older code, metrics, and notes may still say `compaction`. In the
architecture, read that as checkpoint generation switching plus later
old-generation cleanup, not as a garbage-collection model.

## Dashboard And UI Surfaces

The dashboard and preferences are reporting/control surfaces. They may request
service-worker mutations or scheduler ticks, but they do not own queue truth.

Dashboard reads should move toward service-worker projected state. Snapshot
fallbacks may exist during migration, but they should be labeled stale-capable
and should not mutate authority.

## Content Scripts

Content scripts observe pages and perform foreground page actions after the
service worker grants authority for a specific attempt. They report claims,
milestones, terminal results, and page observations back to the service worker.

Content-side timeout or message failure must not trigger a direct durable write
to coordinator authority maps. It may record local observation only where that
cannot move queue truth.

## Shared Moderation Boundary

Imported moderation data is review and policy input, not a remote command
channel.

Shared moderation can provide:

- source documents;
- profile or Space recommendations;
- provenance;
- labels or intents;
- local-policy inputs.

Only local policy and local user action may turn that input into queued work.
Publication formats should preserve provenance and local decision history, but
publisher intent stays advisory.

## Metrics And Tests

Architecture health should be measurable:

- reconcile ticks requested, changed, no-op, rescheduled;
- durable active rows without confirmed actors;
- provisional/runtime actors without durable active rows;
- rows reclaimed, requeued, failed, or adopted by reconcile;
- pump/nudge/repair yield;
- storage timeout, deadline miss, fallback, abandoned, late-write suppression;
- snapshot write reason, bytes, rows, and call path;
- queued/active/terminal movement per tick window.

Tests should exercise state snapshots directly:

- delayed storage confirmation;
- stale late writes;
- service-worker restart between claim/open/confirm;
- disappeared tabs;
- challenge tabs;
- durable active rows without actors;
- runtime actors without durable rows;
- compatibility progress trying to move terminal truth backward;
- repeated ticks reaching a fixed point or bounded progress.
